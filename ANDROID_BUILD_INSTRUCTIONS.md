# UK Energy Portal - Android App Build Instructions

## 🚨 Important Notice

The Android app has been successfully configured and is ready to build! However, building Android apps requires the Android SDK and development tools that are not available in this web environment.

## 📱 What Has Been Created

✅ **Complete Android Project Structure**
- Capacitor configuration (`capacitor.config.ts`)
- Android project files in `android/` directory
- Build scripts (`build-android-app.sh` and `build-android-app.bat`)
- Next.js static export configuration
- All necessary dependencies installed

✅ **Ready-to-Build Files**
- `android/` - Complete Android Studio project
- `out/` - Built web application (static files)
- Build scripts for automated APK generation
- Comprehensive documentation

## 🛠️ How to Build the Android App

### Option 1: Use the Automated Build Scripts

#### On Windows:
```cmd
# Double-click or run in Command Prompt
build-android-app.bat
```

#### On Linux/Mac:
```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x build-android-app.sh
./build-android-app.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Build Process

#### Prerequisites
1. **Install Android Studio**
   - Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - Install with default settings (includes Android SDK)

2. **Install Node.js 18+**
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org

#### Build Steps
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Build the web app
npm run build:mobile

# 3. Sync with Android
npm run android:sync

# 4. Build APK using Android Studio
npm run android:open
# This opens Android Studio - then use Build → Generate Signed Bundle/APK

# OR build via command line (after setting up Android SDK)
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## 📦 Expected Output

After successful build, you'll get:
- **APK File**: `uk-energy-portal-debug.apk` (for testing)
- **Installation Guide**: `ANDROID_INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- **App Size**: ~15-20MB
- **Compatible with**: Android 7.0+ devices

## 📱 App Features

The Android app includes:
- ✅ Full UK Energy Portal functionality
- ✅ Dashboard with energy usage charts
- ✅ Billing history and management
- ✅ Account settings and profile
- ✅ Support ticket system
- ✅ Payment processing
- ✅ Native Android experience
- ✅ Offline capability for cached content
- ✅ Responsive design for all screen sizes

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "SDK location not found" Error
This is expected in web environments. To fix:

1. **Install Android Studio** (includes SDK automatically)
2. **Or set ANDROID_HOME manually**:
   ```bash
   # Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
   export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
   ```

### Build Script Fails
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
- Run `npm install` first
- Check internet connection for dependency downloads

### Android Studio Issues
- Use "Open an existing Android Studio project"
- Select the `android/` folder
- Let Android Studio download missing SDK components
- Use Build → Generate Signed Bundle/APK

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Download/Clone this project** to your local machine
2. **Install Android Studio** and Node.js
3. **Run the build script** or follow manual steps
4. **Install the APK** on your Android device
5. **Enjoy the native app experience!**

## 🎯 Alternative: Use Android Studio Directly

1. Open Android Studio
2. Choose "Open an existing Android Studio project"
3. Navigate to and select the `android/` folder
4. Wait for Gradle sync to complete
5. Click Build → Generate Signed Bundle/APK
6. Choose APK and follow the wizard
7. Install the generated APK on your device

## 📞 Support
